  Name: "Hide on Device: Desktop or Mobile Product",
  Description:
    "The Hide on Device feature empowers users to hide specific elements on their website based on the device being used. This functionality allows for an optimized user experience by adapting the content display according to the screen size and device type (mobile or desktop). Whether simplifying mobile layouts or hiding desktop-specific elements, this feature provides flexibility to enhance the overall website presentation across devices.",
  Problem:
    "Many websites display content that may be irrelevant or create a cluttered experience for users based on the device they are using. This results in poor usability and design inefficiencies. Non-technical users need an easy solution to manage content visibility without extensive coding or design expertise.",
  Solution:
    "The Hide on Device feature addresses this by allowing users to toggle visibility of elements between mobile and desktop devices. Users can selectively hide content on mobile screens while keeping it visible on desktops, or vice versa, ensuring that the website looks clean and relevant on any device. The feature is simple to use with a user-friendly interface and no coding required.",
