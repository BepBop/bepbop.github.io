  Name: "Scroll To Feature",
  Description:
    "The Scroll To feature simplifies navigation on landing pages by enabling users to directly access specific sections or forms. By integrating smooth scrolling, customizable triggers, and visual indicators, this feature improves the overall user experience, reduces frustration, and increases task completion rates. Ideal for forms, CTAs, and key content areas, the Scroll To feature aligns with modern usability standards and is essential for enhancing accessibility on complex pages.",
  Problem:
    "On content-rich landing pages, users often find it difficult to locate forms or key sections. The lack of direct navigation leads to confusion, drop-offs, and missed opportunities for engagement or conversions. Non-intuitive navigation methods further exacerbate these issues, particularly for users with limited time or patience.",
  Solution:
    "The Scroll To feature addresses these challenges by providing direct navigation options. Users can click on buttons, links, or navigation items to smoothly scroll to specific forms or sections. Customizable scroll speed and easing settings ensure an optimal experience, while section highlighting confirms the target area. The feature is designed to integrate seamlessly with any page layout, improving accessibility and engagement.",
