  Name: "Design System Migration",
  Description:
    "This project focused on modernizing and migrating the design system from Adobe XD to Figma. By leveraging Figma's collaborative capabilities, the team created a scalable, modular design system with improved workflows and accessibility. The migration addressed inconsistencies in the existing system and enhanced the design and development synergy. The updated design system supports real-time collaboration, accelerates prototyping, and integrates seamlessly with development tools, making it a future-proof solution for scaling product designs.",
  Problem:
    "The legacy design system in Adobe XD was difficult to scale, lacked integration features, and hindered collaboration. Teams faced challenges with maintaining consistency, version control, and accessibility standards, which resulted in inefficiencies and frustration among stakeholders.",
  Solution:
    "The solution involved redesigning and migrating the design system to Figma. The new system featured standardized, modular components designed for scalability and ease of use. Design tokens ensured uniformity in colors, typography, and spacing, while accessibility improvements made the components more inclusive. Real-time collaboration capabilities streamlined workflows across teams, reducing design iteration time and enhancing productivity.",
